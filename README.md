##Prediction Analysis of Electric Vehicle using Machine Learning

The rapid adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) is revolutionizing the global transportation system. However, as the number of EVs continues to grow, charging stations and energy grids are facing challenges in managing power demand efficiently.

This project aims to analyze and predict EV charging patterns using machine learning techniques and real-world data. By examining parameters such as connection time, charging duration, and energy consumed, the project seeks to uncover behavioral trends in EV charging and forecast future energy requirements.

The results will enable smarter energy management by helping:
Optimize power distribution at charging stations
Prevent overloading during peak hours
Promote renewable energy utilization
Support better planning of EV infrastructure for sustainable growth
Keywords: Electric Vehicle, Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Charging Pattern Prediction, Smart Grid Optimization.
